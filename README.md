This project involves analyzing and gaining insights from a dataset containing e-commerce tables using SQL and Python. The analysis is facilitated by a combination of SQL for data retrieval and manipulation, Python libraries like Pandas for data processing, and libraries like Matplotlib or Seaborn for visualization. Here's a detailed breakdown of how the project can be approached:

Project Overview: E-commerce Data Insights using SQL and Python
E-commerce platforms generate large amounts of transactional data, including information about products, orders, customers, and payments. By analyzing this data, businesses can gain insights into customer behavior, product performance, and overall sales trends. In this project, you will use a dataset consisting of various e-commerce tables (like order_items, payments, sellers, customers, etc.) and extract meaningful insights using SQL for data extraction and Python for further data analysis and visualization.
